# The Book Heaven

## What is this?

**The Book Heaven is a community library where readers recommend their favorite books to each other.**

Ever finished a great book and wished you could tell the world about it? Or browsed a bookstore with no idea what to pick next? The Book Heaven fixes both: instead of a store you buy from, it is a place where people share the books they love — complete with a short note on why it is worth reading, a 1–5 star rating, and a public profile showing every book they have recommended.

Anyone can browse the growing collection and search for books by title, author, or genre. When a reader wants to add a book, they sign in, submit their recommendation, and it goes through a simple moderation queue — admins approve or deny submissions so the library only ever shows quality, real recommendations. There is also a "favorites" system so members can keep a personal list of books they want to read next.

In short: **a community-run, moderated space for sharing and discovering great reads.**

## How it works (in 30 seconds)

1. **Visitors** browse the "Community Library", search, read book details and reviews.
2. **Signed-in members** recommend books, rate and review approved titles, save favorites, and manage their recommendations from a personal dashboard.
3. **Admins** moderate submissions through a control panel — approving or denying books before they become visible to everyone.

## Frontend & Backend

- A web app (frontend) built with Next.js
- A REST API (backend) built with Express and MongoDB

## Features

- **Community Library** – Browse all books with a responsive grid of generated book covers.
- **Recommend a Book** – Signed-in readers can submit a recommendation (title, author, genre, description).
- **Moderation workflow** – Submitted books land in `pending` and are approved or denied by admins before becoming publicly visible.
- **Live search** – Debounced, keyboard-navigable search across title, author, genre, and description.
- **Book details** – Cover, metadata, recommender link, description, favorite toggle, edit and delete (owner or admin).
- **Reviews & ratings** – 1–5 star ratings with editable comments; verified after a book is approved.
- **Related books** – Books sharing the same genre shown on the details page.
- **Favorites** – Authenticated users can favorite books and manage them from their dashboard.
- **Public profiles** – `user/[username]` pages show a reader's approved recommendations; owners also see their favorites and pending books.
- **Dashboard** – Personal view (favorites + recommendations) for the signed-in user.
- **Admin panel** – Dedicated drawer listing Pending / Approved / Denied books with approve/deny actions.
- **Auth & roles** – Clerk-powered sign-in/sign-up; `admin` role gates the admin panel and moderation API.

## Architecture

```
Browser (Next.js client)
   │  axios (REST, Bearer token from Clerk)
   ▼
Express API  (PORT 5000, /api/...)
   │  @clerk/express (verify JWT/session)
   ▼
MongoDB  (Mongoose, connection in config/db.js)
```

- The **frontend** communicates with the backend through `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (e.g. `http://localhost:5000`).
- **Clerk** provides authentication. The client signs in via Clerk and attaches a JWT (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`) from `getToken()`; the backend verifies it with `clerkMiddleware()` and helpers in `middleware/auth.middleware.js`.
- **Roles** are read from Clerk user metadata (`metadata.role === "admin"`). Admins can access `/admin/*` routes and the moderation endpoints.
- **Moderation**: books created by non-admins start with `status: "pending"`. Only `allowed` books appear in the public catalog, search, related books, and public profiles.

### User flows

1. **Visitor** – browses the catalog, searches, reads book details and reviews, visits public profiles.
2. **Signed-in user** – additionally recommends books (enters moderation), favorites books, reviews approved books, edits/deletes own content, accesses `/dashboard`.
3. **Admin** – sees/admin the admin panel, approves or denies pending books, and can delete/modify any content.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (the frontend targets Next.js 16 / React 19)
- npm
- MongoDB (connection URI, e.g. a Mongo Atlas cluster)
- A [Clerk](https://clerk.com) application (publishable + secret keys)

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd the-book-heaven-backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # or create .env manually (see below)
npm start              # runs node server.js on PORT 5000
```

Required `.env` values:

```
PORT=5000
DB_URI=<your mongo connection string>
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<clerk publishable key>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<clerk secret key>
```

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd the-book-heaven-frontend
npm install
npm run dev            # Next.js dev server (default http://localhost:3000)
```

Required `.env` values:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<clerk publishable key>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<clerk secret key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 3. Giving a user the `admin` role

In the Clerk dashboard, add `role: "admin"` to the user's public metadata (or session claims). The admin panel (`/admin`) and moderation API routes will then be accessible to that user.

## Scripts

| Folder | Command | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| frontend | `npm run dev` | Start Next.js in development |
| frontend | `npm run build` | Production build |
| frontend | `npm run start` | Start production server |
| frontend | `npm run lint` | Run ESLint (Next.js) |
| backend | `npm start` | Run the Express server (`node server.js`) |

Note: the backend declares `nodemon` as a dependency; you can run `npx nodemon server.js` for hot reload during development.

---

## Notes

- **Covers are generated** in CSS/Tailwind — each book renders a stylized cover with a deterministic palette derived from its id/title (no image uploads).
- The frontend bundles a design skill (`skill.md`) with guidance for building Tailwind-based UIs; it is a working aid, not part of the product runtime.
- The frontend `README.md` and backend `README.md` contain app-specific deep dives referenced from this file.
